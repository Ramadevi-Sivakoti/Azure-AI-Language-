Custom NER is part of Azure AI Language in Azure AI services.


Azure AI Language provides certain built-in entity recognition, to recognize things such as a person, location, organization, or URL. 
Built-in NER allows you to set up the service with minimal configuration, and extract entities. 
To call a built-in NER, create your service and call the endpoint for that NER service like this:

<YOUR-ENDPOINT>/text/analytics/v3.0/entities/recognition/general


High quality data will let you spend less time refining and yield better results from your model.

1. Diversity - use as diverse of a dataset as possible without losing the real-life distribution expected in the real data. 
You'll want to use sample data from as many sources as possible, each with their own formats and number of entities. 
It's best to have your dataset represent as many different sources as possible.
2. Distribution - use the appropriate distribution of document types. 
A more diverse dataset to train your model will help your model avoid learning incorrect relationships in the data.
3. Accuracy - use data that is as close to real world data as possible. 
Fake data works to start the training process, but it likely will differ from real data in ways that can cause your model to not extract correctly.


The Azure AI Language service enforces the following restrictions:

Training - at least 10 files, and not more than 100,000
Deployments - 10 deployment names per project
APIs:
      Authoring - this API creates a project, trains, and deploys your model. Limited to 10 POST and 100 GET per minute
      Analyze - this API does the work of actually extracting the entities; it requests a task and retrieves the results. Limited to 20 GET or POST
Projects - only 1 storage account per project, 500 projects per resource, and 50 trained models per project
Entities - each entity can be up to 500 characters. You can have up to 200 entity types.
