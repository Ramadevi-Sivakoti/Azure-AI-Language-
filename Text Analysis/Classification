Custom text classification assigns labels, which in the Azure AI Language service is a class that the developer defines, to text files. 
For example, a video game summary might be classified as "Adventure", "Strategy", "Action" or "Sports".

=> Custom text classification falls into two types of projects:

1. Single label classification -
You can assign only one class to each file. Following the above example, 
a video game summary could only be classified as "Adventure" or "Strategy".

2. Multiple label classification - 
You can assign multiple classes to each file. 
This type of project would allow you to classify a video game summary as "Adventure" or "Adventure and Strategy".

Labeling data correctly, especially for multiple label projects, is directly correlated with how well your model performs. 
The higher the quality, clarity, and variation of your data set is, the more accurate your model will be.


Evaluating and improving your model:


In the real world, documents result in different kinds of errors when a classification isn't correct:

False positive - model predicts x, but the file isn't labeled x.
False negative - model doesn't predict label x, but the file in fact is labeled x.

These metrics are translated into three measures provided by Azure AI Language:

1. Recall - Of all the actual labels, how many were identified; the ratio of true positives to all that was labeled.
2. Precision - How many of the predicted labels are correct; the ratio of true positives to all identified positives.
3. F1 Score - A function of recall and precision, intended to provide a single score to maximize for a balance of each component
