Utterances:
Utterances are the phrases that a user might enter when interacting with an application that uses your language model. 

Intent:
An intent represents a task or action the user wants to perform, or more simply the meaning of an utterance.

You create a model by defining intents and associating them with one or more utterances.
In addition to the intents that you define, every model includes a None intent that you should use to explicitly identify utterances that a user might submit,
but for which there is no specific action required 
for example, conversational greetings like "hello") or that fall outside of the scope of the domain for this model.

Entities:
Entities are used to add specific context to intents. 
For example, you might define a TurnOnDevice intent that can be applied to multiple devices, and use entities to define the different devices.

You can split entities into a few different component types:

1. Learned entities are the most flexible kind of entity, and should be used in most cases. 
You define a learned component with a suitable name, and then associate words or phrases with it in training utterances. When you train your model,
it learns to match the appropriate elements in the utterances with the entity.

2. List entities are useful when you need an entity with a specific set of possible values 
for example, days of the week. You can include synonyms in a list entity definition,
so you could define a DayOfWeek entity that includes the values "Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", and so on; each with synonyms like "Sun", "Mon", "Tue", and so on.

3. Prebuilt entities are useful for common types such as numbers, datetimes, and names.
For example, when prebuilt components are added, you will automatically detect values such as "6" or organizations such as "Microsoft".
