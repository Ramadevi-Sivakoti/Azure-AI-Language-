After creating and testing a knowledge base, you can improve its performance with active learning and by defining synonyms.

Active learning:
Active learning can help you make continuous improvements to get better at answering user questions correctly over time. 
People often ask questions that are phrased differently, but ultimately have the same meaning. 
Active learning can help in situations like this because it enables you to consider alternate questions to each question and answer pair.
Active learning is enabled by default.


Synonyms:
Synonyms are useful when questions submitted by users might include multiple different words to mean the same thing. 
For example, a travel agency customer might refer to a "reservation" or a "booking". 
By defining these as synonyms, the question answering service can find an appropriate answer regardless of which term an individual customer uses.

To define synonyms, you use the REST API to submit synonyms in the following JSON format:
{
    "synonyms": [
        {
            "alterations": [
                "reservation",
                "booking"
                ]
        }
    ]
}
