Real-world data issues:

It's important to realize that most real-world data are influenced by factors that weren't recorded at the time. 
For example, we might have a table of race-car track times alongside engine sizes;
but various other factors that weren't written down, such as the weather, probably also played a role. 
If problematic, we can often reduce the influence of these factors by increasing the size of the dataset.

OUTLIERS:
Data points that are clearly outside of what's expected—also known as "outliers"—can sometimes be safely removed from analyses, 
although we must take care to not remove data points that provide real insights.

BIAS:
An error in the data, often subtle or unnoticed.



Real-world data will always have issues, but data scientists can often overcome these issues by:

Checking for missing values and badly recorded data.
Considering removing obvious outliers.
Examining what real-world factors might affect their analysis and determining if their dataset size is large enough to reduce the impact of these factors.
Checking for biased raw data and considering their options to fix the bias, if found.
