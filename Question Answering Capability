Azure AI Language includes a question answering capability, which enables you to define a knowledge base of question and answer pairs that can be queried using natural language input.
The knowledge base can be published to a REST endpoint and consumed by client applications, commonly bots.

To create a question answering solution, you can use the REST API or SDK to write code that defines, trains, and publishes the knowledge base. 
To create a knowledge base you:

Sign in to Azure portal.

Search for Azure AI services using the search field at the top of the portal.

Select Create under the Language Service resource.

Create a resource in your Azure subscription:

Enable the question answering feature.
Create or select an Azure AI Search resource to host the knowledge base index.
In Language Studio, select your Azure AI Language resource and create a Custom question answering project.

Add one or more data sources to populate the knowledge base:

URLs for web pages containing FAQs.
Files containing structured text from which questions and answers can be derived.
Predefined chit-chat datasets that include common conversational questions and responses in a specified style.
Edit question and answer pairs in the portal.
