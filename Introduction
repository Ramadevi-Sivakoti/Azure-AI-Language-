2.Key phrase extraction - identifying important words and phrases in the text that indicate the main points.
3.Sentiment analysis - quantifying how positive or negative the text is.
4.Named entity recognition - detecting references to entities, including people, locations, time periods, organizations, and more.
5.Entity linking - identifying specific entities by providing reference links to Wikipedia articles.
